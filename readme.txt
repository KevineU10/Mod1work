Explanation:
Import: Imports the random module for generating random data.
generate_workers: Creates a list of num_workers with random names, salaries, and genders.
generate_payment_slip: Generates a payment slip for a given worker.
Calculates the employee level based on the given conditions.
Prints the payment slip details.
Includes a try-except block for error handling.
Main block: Generates 400 workers, iterates over them, and calls generate_payment_slip for each.

Step 2: Dynamic Worker List
The generate_workers function creates a list of workers dynamically.

Step 3: For Loop
The for loop iterates over the workers list and calls generate_payment_slip for each worker.

Step 4: Conditional Statements
The conditional statements are implemented within the generate_payment_slip function to determine the employee level.

Step 5: Exception Handling
The try-except block in generate_payment_slip handles potential errors during the payment slip generation process.

Step 6: Conversion to R
Key differences:
R uses data.frame for structured data.
sample function is used for random generation.
cat function is used for printing output.
Indexing in R starts from 1.
